        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Hello! If you’re reading this, you’ve stumbled into my wild corner of the internet, where code meets chaos 
            and ideas fly faster than I can catch them. But let’s talk about something serious for a moment—your privacy.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl text-green-400 mb-4">What’s happening on this site? 
            <small class="text-xs text-gray-400">(no idea what this is or why)</small>
        </h3>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">Ideas on the Edge of Madness</strong>: Sometimes I post projects 
            and code here that seemed brilliant to me at 2 AM. How useful are they? Time will tell!</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">A Collection of Bugs</strong>: Here you can find bugs of all kinds 
            and sizes. Most of them are the result of experimentation and creativity.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">Weird Functions</strong>: I have a habit of writing functions just 
            because "why not?". Will they be finished? Well, someday. Maybe.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">"Unique" Code</strong>: This site may contain some of the most 
            interesting and strange pieces of code you've ever seen. However, not all of them work as intended.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl text-green-400 mb-4">What do we collect?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            We do not collect any unnecessary data. However, for certain functions to work properly (like the chat), the following may be used:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">Nickname and Password</strong>: For logging into the site.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-white">Cookies</strong>: For storing sessions and ensuring stable operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl text-green-400 mb-4">How do we use your data?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Your data is used for:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Authorization: Nickname and password are used for logging into the site.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Service Improvement: Cookies help remember your preferences and maintain your session.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl text-red-400 mb-4">Disclaimer</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            I do not guarantee that anything on this site works correctly or reliably. If you accidentally found something useful here—either it was magic or incredible luck.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Updates and fixes? Of course, as soon as I figure out what exactly I did.</p>
