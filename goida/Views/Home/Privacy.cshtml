    <h2>Welcome to the Chaos Zone! 🎉🍕</h2>

    <p>Hello! If you’re reading this, you’ve stumbled into my wild corner of the internet, where code meets chaos and ideas fly faster than I can catch them. But let’s talk about something serious for a moment—your privacy.</p>

    <h3>What’s happening on this site? <small><small><small><small> no idea what this is or why</small></small></small></small></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ideas on the Edge of Madness</strong>: Sometimes I post projects and code here that seemed brilliant to me at 2 AM. How useful are they? Time will tell!</li>
        <li><strong>A Collection of Bugs</strong>: Here you can find bugs of all kinds and sizes. Most of them are the result of experimentation and creativity.</li>
        <li><strong>Weird Functions</strong>: I have a habit of writing functions just because "why not?". Will they be finished? Well, someday. Maybe.</li>
        <li><strong>"Unique" Code</strong>: This site may contain some of the most interesting and strange pieces of code you've ever seen. However, not all of them work as intended.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What do we collect?</h3>
    <p>We do not collect any unnecessary data. However, for certain functions to work properly (like the chat), the following may be used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nickname and Password</strong>: For logging into the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: For storing sessions and ensuring stable operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do we use your data?</h3>
    <p>Your data is used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authorization: Nickname and password are used for logging into the site.</li>
        <li>Service Improvement: Cookies help remember your preferences and maintain your session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>I do not guarantee that anything on this site works correctly or reliably. If you accidentally found something useful here—either it was magic or incredible luck.</p>

    <p>Updates and fixes? Of course, as soon as I figure out what exactly I did.</p>
